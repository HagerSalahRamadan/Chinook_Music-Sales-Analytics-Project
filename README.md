## Project Workflow & Tools

Source: Chinook SQL Database (normalized schema with fact and dimension tables)
Tools: Excel, Power Query, Power pivot, DAX (Measures).
Modeling: Star schema with clear relationships between fact and dimension tables (Invoice_line, Invoices, Customers, Employees, Tracks, Albums, Artists, Genres, Playlists)

- **Import & Clean Data Using Power Query**:
Imported all tables (like Invoice, InvoiceLine, Customer, Track, Album, etc.) From SQL Server Database into Excel.
Opened Power Query Editor for each table:
Removed unnecessary columns.
Verified data types (e.g., text, whole number, decimal).
Removed duplicates or blanks if any.
Loaded each table and "Add this data to the Data Model"

- **Data Modeling in Power Pivot**: 
Identified Fact table: InvoiceLine
Identified Dimension tables: Invoice, Customer, Track, Album, Genre, Artist, MediaType, Employee.
Created relationships by dragging keys (One-to-Many)

- **Using SQL Queries in Power Query**: Wrote over 30 analytical queries, including revenue trends, customer patterns, and genre performance
ðŸ§  Used advanced SQL: CTEs, Window Functions, Ranking, Aggregations, and automated KPI reporting using DAX
